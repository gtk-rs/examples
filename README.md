# gtk-rs examples [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gtk-rs/examples.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gtk-rs/examples) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/pi27a5xubp0ihl2d?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/GuillaumeGomez/examples)

A few gtk-rs examples. To build, just do:

```Shell
> cargo build
```

or to enable GTK 3.x depending on the version needed by the example (check Cargo.toml `[features]` to see all specific GTK compile features available):

```Shell
> cargo build --features gtk_3_18
> cargo build --all-features
```

And then run the executables with:

``` Shell
> ./target/debug/EXAMPLE-NAME
```

or with cargo run (repeating the compilation features used above), example:

``` Shell
> cargo run --all-features --bin EXAMPLE-NAME
```

Please be sure to have installed all the required libraries before building examples (the list is available on the [gtk-rs](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk/) repository).
